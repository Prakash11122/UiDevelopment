    Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
    York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of
    the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our
    bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our stern alarums changed to merry
    meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war
    hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;

    adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious
    pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor
    made to court an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamp'd, and
    want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am
    curtail'd of this fair proportion,
